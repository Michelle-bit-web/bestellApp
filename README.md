# 🥙 BestellApp - Order, Pick-Up & Delivery

This project is a rebuild of my existing BestellApp landingpage. I am currently working on a full-stack application with React Vite for the frontend, GSAP-powered animations, and Django for the backend API. <br>
BestellApp is a food ordering application that allows users to browse menus, place orders and choose between delivery or pick-up options.

## Demo

Live demo: [Coming soon](https://michelle-bit-web.github.io/bestell-app)

## 🪄 Features

📋 Browse Menus – View detailed menus with descriptions, prices, and images.

🛒 Easy Ordering – Add food and drinks to your cart with a single tap.
